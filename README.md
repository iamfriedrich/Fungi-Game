# Fungi-Game
This is a simpler version of fungi game written in Java. Please first watch this YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAHPTUujaEc before starting to play this game. However, this video contains the rules of the original game. To avoid any confusion, our game does not have a night card pile or moon cards, night cards and day cards are in the same pile, does not keep the hand cards secret but are always visible, does not have a "Destroying Angel" mushroom so you can skip the video between 3:45-5:40, does work under the assumption that the player can always take any of the five actions, does not have a discard pile and used cards just disappear, adds points as we play instead of waiting until the end of the game, does not have a reference card but the options are always visible on the prompt and calls "Display" to "Player area". You should enter "./run.sh graphic" on your terminal to run this game, I hope you will enjoy yourselves. If you like this game, please follow me on GitHub, I will appreciate, thanks so much.
